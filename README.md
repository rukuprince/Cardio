# Cardiovascular disease prediction

Cardiovascular disease is a general term that refers to a class of diseases that involve the heart and blood vessels. These diseases can include conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and hypertension (high blood pressure). Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide.

Coronary artery disease is the most common type of cardiovascular disease. It occurs when the arteries that supply blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked due to the buildup of plaque, which is made up of cholesterol, fat, and other substances. This can lead to chest pain (angina) and, in severe cases, a heart attack.

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. This can be caused by various factors, including coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, and previous heart attacks.

Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a condition in which the blood flow through the arteries is consistently too high. This can cause damage to the blood vessels and other organs, such as the heart, brain, and kidneys.

There are many factors that can increase a person's risk of developing cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, alcohol, and a sedentary lifestyle. Many of these risk factors can be controlled or modified through lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and quitting smoking.

In this end-to-end project, I tried to desing a model which using a given dataset and user information will predict wether the user will have cardiovascular disease in the future or no.
